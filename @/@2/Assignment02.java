		// ask for bag size (as an integer, use the constants from PotatoChipBag
		// ask for the weight, accepting any number of decimal places
		// determine if the bag is good or bag
		//   increment a bag counts for good, bad, total
		// print out the good, bad, total bags
		// output your name as in ACSIS
		// ask if there is more data (Yes, No) continuing on any Yes (not case
		// sensitive)
		// NOTE: You can use any kind of loop, or decision structure you 
		//       would like. However a for loop is not recommended.
		// Remember: if the entered chip bag size is incorrect, do not
		//           increase any counts, report an error, and keep the program
		//           running (if text is input instead of a number the program
		//           can crash, this is okay for this assignment)
